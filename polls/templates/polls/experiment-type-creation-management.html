    <p>Each experiment-type comes with different task presentation and task annotation orientation,
        after creating an experiment type, say A/B, you'll need to create all ExperimentType-task-presentation for it,
        which for example can look like, AA, AB, BA etc. Also you'll need to create an ExperimentType-task-annotation for it,
        which can for example look like XX, XY, YX etc. If you don't understand this, headover to the Admin Quickstart page.
