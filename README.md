# audio-discrimination-crowdsource

Web service to crowd-source audio discrimination data

## Getting Started

### Local dev

This is the one time setup:
```
mkdir .venv
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pre-commit install
```

And this is how you run it locally:
```
source .venv/bin/activate
export DEVELOPMENT_MODE='local'
export GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID='<your_client_id>'
export GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET='<your_client_secret>'
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
#python manage.py startapp polls
DEBUG=True python manage.py runserver
```
- Load `fixtures.json` according to [OAuth Setup](#OAuth-Setup).

### Digital Ocean apps

There is a production app and a staging app, set up separately.
The staging app builds and deploys when there are pushed to `main` branch.
The production app builds and deploys when there are pushed to
`prod` branch. (We only selectively merge `main` into `prod`.)

- Create Digital Ocean App
  - Service Provider: Github
  
  - Run command should be:
  ```
  $(pyenv which gunicorn) gunicorn --worker-tmp-dir /dev/shm django_app.wsgi
  ```
  (This is slightly wrong but appears to work.)
  - Use the bulk editor to set the values as follows. The last three
  values should be encrypted.
  ```
  DATABASE_URL=${db.DATABASE_URL}
  DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS=${APP_DOMAIN}
  DEBUG=[False|True]
  DEVELOPMENT_MODE=['staging'|'production']
  DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=********************
  GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=********************
  GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=********************
  ```
  - $5.00/mo â€“ Basic 512 MB RAM | 1 vCPU  x  1
- Create a free static site.
  - Add another app resource from the same github branch.
  - Edit the resource type to 'static site'.
  - HTTP route should be `/static`
  - Output directory should be `staticfiles`
- Create a dev postgres database for $7/mo.

- After the first build + deploy
  - Add domain name in app settings (should be the domain authorized
  for Google OAuth).

- Run `python manage.py migrate`
- Run `python manage.py createsuperuser`
- Run `python manage.py loaddata fixtures/allauth.json` to load fixtures.

### OAuth Setup

One-time Google OAuth setup:
- Visit this link: [Google Api](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard)
- Goto `OAuth consent screen` and setup
- Go to `Credentials` and click on `CREATE CREDENTIALS` > `OAuth client ID` choose options
    - for local:
        - set `Authorized JS origins` to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
	    - set `Authorized redirect URIs` to
    	`http://127.0.0.1:8000/accounts/google/login/callback/` and
    	`http://localhost:8000/accounts/google/login/callback/`
    - for production:
        - set `Authorized JS origins` to `https://audiodiscrimination.com`
	    - set `Authorized redirect URIs` to
    	`https://audiodiscrimination.com/accounts/google/login/callback/`


## Theme App

Theme app is a django app consisting of the main theme of the application.
This can be reused in other applications as well.

To use the themeapp in the application, following things need to be done:

In settings.py, make sure static settings is configured

```
STATIC_URL = "/static/"
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')
STATICFILES_DIRS = [
    BASE_DIR / 
    "assets",
]
```

All assets of the theme needs to keep inside assets folder

Now, for any new html page, we need to do the following:

```
{% extends 'base.html' %}
{% load static %}

{% block css-block%}
// any extra css here
{% endblock %}

{% block body-block%}
// Main Content of the page here
{% endblock %}

{% block js-block%}
// any extra js here
{% endblock %}

```

# Deployment to Fly.io

## Install FlyCtl

To work with the Fly platform, you first need to install Flyctl, a command line interface that allows you to do everything from creating an account to deploy to Fly.
  - Linux:
    ```  
    curl  -L https://fly.io/install.sh | sh
    ```
  - OSX:
    ```
    brew install flyctl
    ```
  - Windows:
    ```
    iwr https://fly.io/install.ps1 -useb
    ```  
    Visit `https://fly.io/` if you need installation guide


Next authenticate with your fly.io account:
  ```
  fly auth login
  ```

- To make sure everything is working well:    
  ```
  fly apps list
  ```
The output of the above command will be empty table since you have no apps launched yet


## Configure the Project

### Environment Variables

We shouldn't store secrets in source code, so utilizing environmental variables is needed.
- Run the following from the root of your project
  ```
  python3 set_env.py
  ```

### Deploy App

In this step the app is going to be launched to fly.io.
- Create and configure the app  
  ```
  python3 launch
  ```
    
This command will create you an app on Fly.io , spin up a postgres instance, and create an app configuration named fly.toml in your project root. fly.toml file contains all app details.
  
Copy the DATABASE_URL from the termial output of the above process(fly launch)
and Update DATABASE_URL in .env file.

- To make sure the app is created successfully:
  ```
  fly apps list
  ```
  This command prints 3 apps: 
  1. your app
  2. database instance and 
  3. Fly builders: to build docker images

#### Import Secrets
 - This is neccassary step
    ```
    flyctl secrets import -a <app-name> .env
    ```
    Or you can add one at a time
    ```
    fly secrets set DEBUG="1"
    fly secrets set SECRET_KEY="<your-key>"
    fly secrets set ALLOWED_HOSTS="localhost 127.0.0.1 [::1 <your_app_hostname>" 
    fly secrets set CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS="https://<your_app_hostname>"    
    ```

#### Deploy

- To deploy the app to the FLY platform.
  ```
  fly deploy
  ```

- Open the app in browser
  ```  
  fly open
  ```
